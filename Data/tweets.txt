@Bill_Porter nice to know that your site is back :-)
@sudhamshu after trying out various tools to take notes and I found that paper is the best to take notes and to maintain todo lists.
@neetashankar Yeah, I got the connection. I am getting 20 mbps for a 15 mbps connection. Customer service is also good.

Finally, some relief from Bangalore super hot summer. Hope the rain reduced the soaring temperature.

What is the process to report email spam (offers emails)? @ICICIBank_Care is sending me lot of spam without an option to unsubscribe
@ICICIBank_Care Also in your spam (offers) emails, there is no link to unsubscribe. Also I didn't subscribe to it in the first place.
@ICICIBank_Care I have already done that! thrice!!, but you keep sending me spam. Just today I got more than 2 spam (offers) mails from you

@realsubbuj I am not sure if it is available in my area though...
@ckailash Yeah, he already told me about it. Any idea how much is the discount?
@ckailash Wow! that's good to know. Hopefully it will end all my broadband issues. Also, the service guy was very professional.
@varunkumar That's good to know.
@galuano1 Yeah I have a port right across my home and the service guy said he can give me connection.
As anyone used ACT broadband in Bangalore? They are promising 15 and 25 mbps. Not sure whether I can trust them.

@BabaSherlock I am still on 2.3.7 since HTC Hero doesn't support cynogenmod with Jelly Bean.
Finally after two months I renewed my passport. I documented the entire process, so that it is useful for others http://t.co/jiofjNPt
@BabaSherlock Okay just updated. Didn't choose to wipe data and cache. Rom got updated after reboot and my data and apps are still there.
@BabaSherlock Thanks. Also read that it is better to do a backup using Titanium Backup. Doing that as well before updating.
@BabaSherlock Yes I have @CyanogenMod installed. Rom manager just told me that there is an update and has downloaded it. Phone HTC Hero
@BabaSherlock So if I backup and then update @CyanogenMod Is it possible to restore only apps and data? How to do it?
Question: If I update my @CyanogenMod ROM, using ROM Manager will it wipe my data and apps or they will be retrained? #android
An interesting fact about my observation of people closing their Facebook account. 90 % of them are girls and they have multiple accounts.
@realsubbuj yeah and I noticed lot are actually closing their Facebook account these days.
@sudhamshu well actually even I agree with you. The starting was good, but ended up pretty abruptly.
Out of ~300 friends that I have in Facebook, I just found that ~15 have closed their accounts. Is this starting of a trend?
These days @Airtel_Presence is adding a person's name at the end of their replies. Nice move. It gives a personal touch.
@mayurpipaliya ha ha. Guilty as charged ;) Hope you enjoy them :)
Every few months @Airtel_Presence randomly activates some service for me. Now they started sending me some crap as MMS from 58685.
Just closed two browser windows full of tabs containing articles that I wanted to read, and pretended as if nothing happened #tab #inboxzero
I hate websites which automatically expire your password after x days. They are making the service more insecure.
Suddenly after moving from 20-something to 30-something over the weekend, I  feel more mature, or is it just my mind playing games again ;)
